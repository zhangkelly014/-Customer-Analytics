# Customer Analytics

### Cluster analysis and dimensionality reduction to help to segment the customers.
- We used both hierarchical and flat clustering techniques, ultimately focusing on the K-means algorithm. We also combined it with Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reach an even better insight about our customers.

### Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis.  
- Once segmented, customersâ€™ behavior requires some interpretation. We obtained the descriptive statistics by brand and by segment and visualizing the findings. Through the descriptive analysis, we formed our hypotheses about our segments, thus ultimately setting the ground for the subsequent modeling.

### Elasticity modeling for purchase probability, brand choice, and purchase quantity  
- We calculated purchase probability elasticity, brand choice own price elasticity, brand choice cross-price elasticity, and purchase quantity elasticity. We used linear regressions and logistic regressions. 

### Deep Learning to predict future behavior  
- Result: reached 90%+ accuracy in our predictions about the future behavior of our customers.

Packages - NumPy, SciPy, pickle TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.
